Siqueira, Rozane. (2001). IVA Uniforme Com Renda Básica: uma Proposta de Reforma da Política Tributária e Social no Brasil. In Brazil, while taxes are directly or indirectly levied on all people, rich and poor, social spending has to a great extent failed to reach the latter. This study argues that, given that the existing fiscal structure reflects the presence of strong administrative and institutional constraints, these should be carefully taken into account in the policy reform debate. In particular, it is emphasised the crucial role played by indirect taxes and the need to think both sides of the budget simultaneously. In the light of this argument, the study proposes for Brazil a scheme comprising a flat rate VAT on all goods and services together with universal and unconditional transfers to families or individuals. Such a scheme leads to a drastic simplification of the tax system and increases its efficiency, at the same time that it is highly progressive, contributing to significantly reduce the intensity of poverty in Brazil.
